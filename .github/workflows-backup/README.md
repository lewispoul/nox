# Workflow Backup Files

This directory contains backup/alternative versions of GitHub Actions workflows.

## Files:

- `ci.yml.broken` - Previous complex CI workflow with extensive testing phases
- `cd.yml.backup` - Backup version of CD workflow with v7.0.0/v8.0.0 configuration

## Note:

These files were moved here during workflow error fixes to:
1. Clean up the main workflows directory
2. Preserve alternative workflow configurations
3. Prevent confusion with active workflows

The active, working workflows are in the parent `.github/workflows/` directory.
