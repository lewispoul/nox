## Rules
- Do **not** switch to IAM 2.0 tasks in this workspace.  
- Follow the **Nox Finalization Checklist** in strict logical order.  
- Do **not** start unrelated tasks without explicit approval.


## Development Guidelines

- Always work in **logical progress order** as described in the Nox Finalization Checklist (Sections 1 â†’ 2 â†’ 3 â†’ 4).
- For incomplete sections, finish **all possible subtasks** before moving to the next section.
- Avoid starting multiple unrelated changes in one commit â€” group changes by feature or section.
- Use consistent code style and follow the existing linting rules.
- When making changes to TypeScript or React components:
  - Keep imports organized.
  - Write or update type definitions as needed.
  - Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` before committing.
- If encountering missing production credentials or external resources, **stub them with safe placeholders** and document what is missing.
- Document all changes in the progress report at the end of each task.
- Before stopping work, leave the repository in a buildable, runnable state.
