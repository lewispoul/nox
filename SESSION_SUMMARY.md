# NOX API Maintenance & Automation Session Summary

**Date:** August 15, 2025

---

## Objectives & Context
- Enhance reliability, automation, and maintainability of the NOX API environment.
- Follow-up on previous work: codebase cleanup, documentation reorganization, onboarding automation, and feature dashboard implementation.

## Key Actions Taken
- **Reviewed and analyzed the existing `nox_repair.sh` self-healing script:**
  - Covers user/group checks, directory/permission fixes, venv integrity, API code validation, environment variable repair, systemd service validation, automated restart, endpoint tests, and detailed reporting.
- **Planned and implemented further enhancements:**
  - Added Python dependency drift detection and auto-repair (syncs venv with `requirements.txt`).
  - Added Redis service connectivity check and auto-restart logic.
  - Structured new checks as modular functions for future extensibility.

## Technical Improvements
- The repair script now automatically detects and repairs:
  - Outdated or missing Python packages (compared to `requirements.txt`).
  - Redis service failures (auto-restarts and validates connectivity).
- The script remains extensible for future service checks (e.g., database, config drift, emergency notifications).

## Next Steps (for future sessions)
- Optionally add further service checks (database, config drift, emergency notifications).
- Test the enhanced repair script in production and review the generated reports.
- Continue iterating on automation and reliability features as needed.
