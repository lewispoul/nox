- Sort functionality (name, method, favorites, recent)
- Active filters indicators with clear-all functionality

### **2. Complete Favorites Management**
- Implemented `useFavorites.ts` hook with localStorage persistence
- Added animated favorite stars to all EndpointCard components
- Favorites counter in enhanced statistics section
- Filter by favorites only functionality
- Robust error handling for localStorage operations

### **3. Comprehensive Theming System**
- Built `useTheme.tsx` with ThemeProvider context
- Support for Light/Dark/System theme modes
- Automatic system preference detection
- Smooth transitions between themes (0.3s)
- Updated CSS with dark mode styles
- Theme toggle integrated in main header

### **4. Enhanced User Experience**
- Improved responsive design for all screen sizes
- Micro-interactions and smooth animations

## 🚀 **Deployment Status**

### **Application Running**
- **URL**: http://localhost:3003
- **Status**: ✅ Successfully running
- **Build**: No errors or warnings
- **Features**: All M9.5 features functional

### **Testing Completed**
- Manual testing of search functionality
- Favorites system validation
- Theme switching verification
- Responsive design testing
- Accessibility checks passed

## 🎯 **Next Steps: M9.6 Performance Optimization**

### **Immediate Actions**
1. **Bundle Size Analysis**: Implement bundle analyzer and identify optimization opportunities
2. **Lazy Loading**: Add component lazy loading for better initial load performance
3. **WebSocket Optimization**: Improve connection management with auto-reconnection
4. **React Optimization**: Add React.memo and useMemo where beneficial
5. **Web Vitals Monitoring**: Implement performance tracking

### **Preparation Complete**
- Architecture is ready for performance optimizations
- All base functionality is solid and tested
- Code structure supports efficient optimization
- User experience baseline established for comparison

## 📋 **Session Notes**

### **Technical Decisions Made**
- **localStorage** chosen for favorites (simple, reliable, fast)
- **CSS classes** for theming (better performance than CSS-in-JS)
- **Context API** for theme management (avoids prop drilling)
- **Separate SearchAndFilters** component (reusability and maintainability)

### **Challenges Overcome**
- Integrating favorites into existing EndpointCard without breaking changes
- Implementing robust localStorage persistence with error handling
- Creating smooth theme transitions without layout shift
- Maintaining performance with real-time search filtering

### **Quality Improvements**
- Enhanced error handling throughout
- Better TypeScript typing for all new features
- Comprehensive accessibility support
- Mobile-optimized interactions
