# The Purpose of Nox

**Nox** is the intelligent backend agent for IAM and beyond.  
It started as a sandbox to run code safely, and evolved into the **core agent OS** that executes, remembers, and reasons.

## Why it exists
- Provide a safe, persistent execution environment for chemistry tools.
- Move IAM from a monolithic app to a client of Nox’s APIs.
- Support autonomy: watchers, schedulers, memory, policies.

## What it does
- Run jobs: XTB, Psi4, ML, CJ.
- Manage artifacts: inputs, outputs, logs, plots.
- Orchestrate pipelines: SMILES → 3D → opt → props → VoD.
- Expose clean APIs to IAM, CLI, or other clients.
- Maintain memory and safety guardrails.

## Long-term vision
- **Nox Core** = agent OS.
- **IAM** = one domain app (energetic materials).
- **Other apps** (data analysis, productivity) can plug in later.
