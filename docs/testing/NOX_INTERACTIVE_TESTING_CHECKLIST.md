## 🛠️ **Development Testing Best Practices**

### **Before Each Feature**
1. Create test cases for new functionality
2. Test existing features to ensure no regression
3. Check responsive behavior on different screen sizes
4. Verify accessibility compliance

### **Before Each Release**
1. Run full manual testing checklist
2. Test on multiple browsers and devices
3. Check performance metrics
4. Verify documentation is up to date

### **Continuous Testing**
1. Test during development, not just at the end
2. Use browser developer tools to check console errors
3. Test with real data, not just mock data
4. Have others test your work (user testing)
