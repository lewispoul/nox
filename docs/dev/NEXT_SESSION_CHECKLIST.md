# Next session checklist — E2E hermetic tests work

Date: 2025-08-20

Purpose
- Short, copy-paste checklist for the next session to finish push/PR and optional formatting.

Current repo state (as of pause)
- Changes committed locally on `main` (commit `8eafb5b`) with E2E work and docs.
- Full test run locally: 50 passed, 1 skipped.
- `gh` (GitHub CLI) not installed in the environment.
- PR UI: you already opened the PR form in the browser (screenshot saved).

Goals for next session (pick one)
1. Create and push a feature branch and open a PR.
2. Optionally run `ruff`/`black` and push formatting changes before PR.

Minimal safe sequence (recommended)
1. Create a feature branch and push it to origin:

```bash
cd /home/lppoulin/nox-api-src
# create branch from current main commit
git checkout -b e2e/hermetic-tests-2025-08-20
# push branch to origin and set upstream
git push -u origin e2e/hermetic-tests-2025-08-20
```

2. Create the PR (web UI) — fastest
- You already have the PR page open; paste the title/body below and click **Create pull request**.

3. Optional: run formatters and push a style commit

```bash
# install formatters in your venv if needed
pip install ruff black
# autofix with ruff then format with black
ruff check --fix .
black .
# commit formatting
git add -A
git commit -m "style: format with ruff/black"
git push
```

Commands to create PR from CLI (optional)
- Install `gh` (Ubuntu/Debian):

```bash
# one-liner recommended by GitHub
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | \
  sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg && \
  sudo chmod go+r /usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg && \
  echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null && \
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y gh

# login and create PR

gh pr create --base main --head e2e/hermetic-tests-2025-08-20 \

  --body "Implemented hermetic E2E tests (ASGITransport), injectable XTB runner, JOBS_FORCE_LOCAL, payload preservation; full test suite: 50 passed, 1 skipped. See docs/dev/E2E-SESSION_SUMMARY.md for run instructions."
```

PR title + body (copy/paste into UI)

Title:

```
E2E: Hermetic tests + XTB runner injection
```

Body:

```
Implemented hermetic E2E tests (ASGITransport), injectable XTB runner, JOBS_FORCE_LOCAL, and payload preservation.
Added/updated tests and docs; full test suite: 50 passed, 1 skipped.

Key changes:
- `api/services/queue.py`: inject `job_id` into payload, `_xtb_runner` injection API (`set_xtb_runner`), return-code-aware result handling, and background enqueue dispatch.
- `api/services/settings.py`: `jobs_force_local` setting (env: `JOBS_FORCE_LOCAL`).
- Tests: `tests/e2e/test_end_to_end.py`, `tests/unit/test_xtb_runner.py`, `tests/unit/test_queue.py` (added/updated).
- Docs: `docs/dev/E2E-SESSION_SUMMARY.md`, `E2E-MILESTONE.md`, `E2E-SESSION_REPORT.md`.

How to run locally:
- Hermetic E2E: `pytest tests/e2e -q`
- Force local XTB runner: `export JOBS_FORCE_LOCAL=1` then run the unit tests

Notes for reviewers:
- Tests are tolerant to queue timing differences (raw state may be `queued` or `running`).
- Recommend running `ruff`/`black` before merging to normalize formatting.
```

Notes and alternatives
- If you prefer I do the branch creation, formatting, and PR creation next session, say "Please do A" and I will perform the steps (I will need `gh` installed or will create the PR via the web UI with prepared content).
- If you want to push from `main` instead of creating a feature branch, note that current changes are already on `main` locally. Creating a branch keeps history tidy.

Quick pickup pointers
- Files to examine next session: `api/services/queue.py`, `tests/e2e/test_end_to_end.py`, `tests/unit/test_xtb_runner.py`, `docs/dev/E2E-SESSION_SUMMARY.md`.
- Test command: `pytest -q` (full) or target specific tests as needed.
